# Demonstration of DyGA  

DyGA (Dynamic Graphical Authenticator) is an authentication mechanism that utilizes an image grid selection sequence for secure authentication. The grid is dynamically shuffled using the **Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm**, ensuring that the grid appears differently on each authentication attempt. This approach enhances security by preventing pattern recognition and brute-force attacks.
